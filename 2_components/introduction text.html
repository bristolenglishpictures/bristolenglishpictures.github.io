                    These materials are designed for adults learning English (UK) right from the beginning. 
                    <br><br>
                    Starting with three letter words; CVCs (consonant vowel consonant) and moving onto to four and five letter words and then short commonly used words, all the letters of the alphabet are gradually introduced. 
                    <br><br>
                    Following this the worksheets cover themes, introducing vocabulary for food, clothes, colours, numbers, the kitchen the garden and many more.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to consolidate learning the materials can be used as matching pairs (picture and word), spelling worksheets, and also crosswords.
                    <br><br>
                    The app <b>Bristol English Pictures</b> (available on Android and IoS) reinforces the vocabulary, so that members of the class can revise the words outside the lessons.
